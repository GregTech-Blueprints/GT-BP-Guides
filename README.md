# GT-BP-Guides

This repository contains the written content for the GTBP guide/wiki website, a community-driven knowledge base focused on GregTech: New Horizons and related GregTech modded Minecraft projects.

The goal is to provide clear, structured, and searchable guides for anyone interested in Gregtech or GT:NH

### What’s in Here

The actual guides and related media that are available on GTBP.

### What's not in Here

Other website contents like footer, front-page and start-a-server page contents. If you have questions or ideas for improvements about those, please create an issue here or contact us via discord.

Again, **this repo holds only the content, not the actual website code**.
The site pulls these files from the main content folder during build/deployment.
