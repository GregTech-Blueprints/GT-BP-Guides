# The Ultimate Tinkers Construct Crossbow

From the moment the first night hits in GregTech: New Horizons, the mobs are unrelenting. Those zombies with fishing rods, skeletons with exploding arrows, gravity creepers and that’s all before we even talk about the infernal mobs in the game. It’s obvious to you straight away that this is not just an easy tech modpack, there is much more to deal with, and survival is your priority.

That’s where the Tinkers Construct Crossbow comes in.

While locked behind the tool forge, this is the highest damage output weapon that you will come across until the very late game.

There is a simple quest in the quest book which explains how to make your starter crossbow and bolts. This is a perfectly adequate start, and we will begin to build upgrades onto this crossbow as we progress through the GT tiers.

## Starter Crossbow + Bolts
### Crossbow:
- Wooden Limb
- Wooden Body
- Obsidian Tough Binding
- Bowstring with regular string

### Bolts:
- Iron Tipped Wooden tool rod
  - Obtained by casting molten iron onto a wooden tool rod in a casting table
- Feather Fletching

> Important Note – The quest for flint and steel gives you a free ball of moss as a reward and the best use for this is on your crossbow bolts so that you have regenerating ammo. If you choose to use this for something else, you will need to progress through Thaumcraft to craft another ball of moss.

## Modifiers
Modifiers for the crossbow are a very simple endeavour as your goals are very straightforward. You want to shoot fast, get lots of loot, never run out of ammo, and do as much damage as possible.

Each of these things will be dealt with by adding a different modifier to your tools.

### Crossbow:
Redstone – Applied to the crossbow to bring the draw speed down to 0.25 seconds. Adding more Redstone beyond this will do nothing. You need a maximum of 250 Redstone (5 modifiers worth) to achieve this draw speed with your forever limbs.

Lapis – This will add luck to your crossbow. Luck is the same as the looting enchantment and goes up to Luck 3. This requires 450 lapis and only takes up 1 modifier slot.

Reinforcement – If you end up with more than 6 modifiers on your crossbow, you may as well start working on making it unbreakable. Your tool will already have Reinforced 4 because of the unstable tough binding so you only need 6 reinforcement modifiers to make the bow unbreakable. The reinforcement upgrade is crafted by either casting steel onto an obsidian large plate or doing the same thing in a fluid solidifier.

There is no benefit to adding quartz to your crossbow. This will only add to the melee damage that it does and that is entirely pointless.

### Bolts:
Moss – This will make your ammo regenerate over time. I have never felt the need to add more than one to my bolts but if you are impatient in the early game and have the Thaumcraft research, adding 2 will make it regen faster.

Quartz – This is a sharpness upgrade for the bolts. The more you add, the more damage they will do. Once you are satisfied with the regen speed of the bolts, just add more quartz every time a modifier slot pops up.

## Steam Age Upgrades
There are already upgrades you can make to your crossbow in steam age if you feel you want the additional damage! Remember that your crossbow needs to be full durability and your bolts need to have full ammo to be able to swap parts.

### Crossbow:
- Blue Slime Limb
- Blue Slime Cystal Body
- Fiery Bowstring

Blue slime can be obtained either when the leaves of a slime true decay or by using the blue slime fluid found on slime island. As you are likely to be farming slime and rubber from slime trees anyway, blue slime should be an easy one to obtain.

> Note that the parts need to be made from blue Slime Crystals, not the blue slime balls. Make sure you grab enough to make as many of the crystals as you need.

There are also green slime crystals available, and they can also be used for tinkers tools but the 2 are NOT interchangeable. Blue slime crystal parts are vastly superior.

For the fiery bowstring, you will have to venture into the nether and kill a few nether spiders. You only need 3 string so 1 big spider should do the trick.

### Bolts:
- Obznite/Alumite tipped Blue Slime tool rod.
  - Obtained by casting Obzinite onto a blue slime tool rod in a casting table
- Slimeleaf Fletching

Slime leaves should be a very easy item to obtain as all of the slime trees you are farming for blue slime will have these. Use a pair of shears and grab a few.

## Low Voltage (LV) Upgrades
If you made all the upgrades to the Crossbow from the Steam section, the LV section can almost just be skipped. Your crossbow and bolts are already very strong and you can deal with almost anything you need to fight with ease. So treat this as an optional section, the upgrades here will make your weapon stronger, but not by a ludicrous margin.

### Crossbow:
- Carbon Limb (Extruder needed)
- Unstable Tough Binding (Extruder needed)

The Carbon limb is a good upgrade as it lowers the draw speed of your crossbow and allowing for higher DPS. This does however significantly lower the durability of the crossbow and I recommed carrying some carbon ingots with you for long journeys. They can be used for repairs. 

If you have been following the guide for the Unbreakable Instamine Hammer in LV, you will already have the unstable ingots needed for the tough binding. If not this upgrade is extremely optional as the only thing it does is add a level of reinforcement above obsidian. If you feel that you must have this upgrade but don’t yet have unstable ingots you will need to find an enchanting table and a division sigil. Both of these can be found in lootgames or alternatively the table can be looted from a wizard tower roguelike dungeon.

Once you have both the Enchanting Table and the Division sigil, you will have to perform the activation ritual before you can craft the unstable ingots. For full details on how to perform the ritual and for some tricks to make the unstable ingot craft cheaper, look at the Hammer Guide.

![LV Crossbow](/img/gtnh/guides/player-gear/ultimate-tinkers-crossbow/06.png)

There is almost no reason at all to upgrade your bolts in LV. There is no significant damage to be gained with any material if you have already upgraded to Alumite bolts.

## Medium Voltage (MV) Upgrades
MV is the tier where you can upgrade your crossbow for the very last time and just hold onto it until the end of the game. This is especially true if you plan to turn off mobs in EV as per the stargate rules. The crossbow you make at this stage will one shot most mobs that you want to fight and even things like the wither will only take a few hits.

### Crossbow:
- Energetic Alloy Limb
- Mana Steel Body (Optional if you want durability above the Blue Slime)

You will need to have done some Botania if you want the Mana Steel option, otherwise you can also settle for Netherstars or Dark Steel. Strictly speaking, they are all unnecessary.

### Bolts:
- Vanadium Steel tipped Energetic Alloy tool rod.
  - Obtained by solidifying Vanadium Steel onto an Energetic Alloy tool rod in an MV fluid solidifier.

These bolts are a huge upgrade over the alumite ones and you will notice the damage difference if you happen to find any mobs that your old bolts were not already one tapping. This combo of bolts and bow will do well over 100 damage per hit.

## Final Upgrades
I want to start this section off by asking a few thought provoking questions. Why are you here? Who do you want to do more than 100 damage to? If you have used your modifiers for damage, you will already one-shot everything that dares to look in your direction. If you are truly a min max player and must keep upgrading your crossbow as the game goes on, please read on.

### Crossbow:
The only further upgrade in terms of damage for the Crossbow itself is in the Limb. You can swap to an Osmiridium Limb once you have a Platline set up and then an Infinity Limb in UHV if you still want to ugrade  your crossbow at that point for some bizarre reason.

The binding as Unstable is already best in slot and the body only offers extra durability. Feel free to use whatever you want for that. Ichorium will give you 650k durability in IV if seeing a bigger number makes you giggle.

### Bolts:
There are meaningful damage upgrades you can keep adding to your bolts at every tier if you want the tool tip to show a bigger number of damage. You will far exceed the health of every mob in the game far before you reach the end of this list.

Upgrade to these materials for the tip of the bolt whenever you unlock them.
- Meteoric Steel (not iron) – HV
- Tungsten Steel – EV
- Palladium – EV/IV
- Adamantium – LuV

> Remember that you can’t just swap out the tip for crossbow bolts. You will have to fluid solidify with a tool rod every time. Keep using an energetic alloy tool rod until you have access to Osmiridium and then swap to that. If you are still upgrading your crossbow in UHV, you can swap to an Infinity tool rod. Do you want to one shot God??
