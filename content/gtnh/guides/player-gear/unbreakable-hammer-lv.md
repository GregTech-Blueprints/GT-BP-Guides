# Unbreakable Insta-Mine Hammer in LV

Resource gathering in GregTech: New Horizons is no small feat. From the moment you step into the world, you're faced with dense ore generation mechanics, limited tool options, and a slow crawl toward automation. Mining by hand in the early game can be painfully time-consuming. Especially when you're constantly repairing tools and chipping away at entire ore veins deep underground.

That’s what makes this early-game hammer so powerful.

In GTNH, tools are a core part of progression, and getting a reliable, fast mining tool early on can drastically improve efficiency. This guide covers how to build a Tinkers' Construct hammer that is not only unbreakable but also capable of insta-mining stone and similar blocks — all as early as LV (Low Voltage).

## Crafting the Unbreakable Hammer: Infrastructure and Magical Wood Preparation
Creating this special hammer requires more than just a Tool Forge and some Tinkers’ parts. In GTNH, the path includes Twilight Forest boss progression, Thaumcraft research, and access to early GT machinery. But the payoff is huge: an unbreakable, modifier-rich hammer that can carry you through the manual mining phase with ease.

### Required Infrastructure
Before you can begin crafting the hammer, you’ll need the following:
- A Smeltery — required both for tool part casting and for crafting the Alumite Large Plates and Seared Stone Slab needed in the Tool Forge recipe.
- A Tool Forge, crafted using:
  - 4 Iron Blocks
  - 1 Tool Station
  - 2 Alumite Large Plates
  - 1 Seared Stone Slab
- Access to the Twilight Forest, specifically to defeat the Ur-Ghast, whose Carminite is a required component in the Magical Wood recipe. It’s a tough encounter, but the Tinkers’ Construct Crossbow makes light work of it.
- Basic Thaumcraft progression, enough to research and craft Magical Wood from your Thaumonomicon.

> Note: Access to the Ur-Ghast’s tower is gated behind the Twilight Forest boss progression. You’ll need to defeat the Naga, Lich, Minoshroom, Hydra, and Knight Phantom in order before you can enter the tower.

> Pro Tip: Loot the tower! The top of the Ur-Ghast Tower contains item frames with Carminite in them. If you're lucky with your drops, looting these frames may mean you only need to fight one Ur-Ghast instead of two to gather the required 14 Carminite for crafting Magical Wood.

## Thaumcraft: Preparing for Magical Wood

Before you can craft Magical Wood, you’ll need to begin Thaumcraft progression — specifically, just enough to unlock the necessary research. In GTNH, this process starts with crafting a wand, and fortunately, it’s possible to get one early in LV.

Your options for a starter wand:
- Craft a 25 Vis Wand as outlined in the questbook. This is the standard route and is enough to begin your magical journey.
- Alternatively, use the Villager Wand Skip to get a 50 Vis Wand via trading. This approach is covered in our Early Game Thaumcraft Guide.

> Don't panic about aluminium! The 25 Vis Wand requires aluminium screws, and while aluminium ingots are typically gated behind the Electric Blast Furnace (EBF), you can obtain them much earlier by visiting the Twilight Forest — Kobolds have a high chance to drop aluminium ingots directly, bypassing the need for an EBF entirely.

Once you have your wand, here’s the rest of what you’ll need to do:
- Craft a Thaumometer and use it to scan the key items listed in the "Just tell me what to scan already" quest. You don’t need to scan everything — just focus on the items you already have access to at this stage. This will unlock enough aspects to proceed.
- Set up a Research Table using scribing tools and two tables.
- Craft an Arcane Workbench by right-clicking a Thaumcraft table with your wand. This is needed for crafting Magical Wood later on.
- Complete the following research path in order to unlock the ability to craft Magical Wood:
  1. Alchemy: Nitor
  2. Alchemy: Alumentum
  3. Alchemy: Essentia Distillation
  4. Artifice: Infusion
  5. New Horizons: Carved Eminence Stone
  6. New Horizons: Magical Wood

> Tip: You do not need to craft every item as you research them. These steps are about clearing the prerequisites in the Thaumonomicon to unlock Magical Wood. You can safely skip crafting Nitor, Alumentum, and the other components if you're focused solely on building your hammer.

Once you’ve completed the required research and fought the Ur-Ghast enough times to obtain 14 Carminite, you’re ready to craft Magical Wood. Each recipe uses 2 Carminite and produces 4 Magical Wood, meaning 14 Carminite will yield exactly 28 Magical Wood.

You’ll only need 27 pieces for your hammer build, but since Magical Wood is crafted in multiples of four, one will go unused.

## The Hammer Craft
### Magical Wood Parts

The reason we craft the entire hammer out of Magical Wood — head, plates, and handle — is because each part grants +2 modifiers, for a total of +8. This bonus is only applied if the hammer is built from Magical Wood from the start. Swapping parts onto an existing tool won't retroactively grant these modifiers.

With these 8 modifier slots, we immediately turn the hammer into a resource-gathering powerhouse:
- Use 1 modifier worth of Lapis to apply Luck III (Fortune 3). This is the maximum level, and it significantly boosts raw ore yields.
- Spend the remaining 7 modifiers on Redstone to increase Mining Speed. This allows the hammer to insta-mine many stone blocks, letting you tear through ore veins faster than any other early-game method.
> Important: Don’t waste any modifier slots on Reinforcement or durability upgrades. Once the tool is upgraded with Unstable Ingots, it becomes Unbreakable by default, no modifiers required.

#### Bonus Modifiers (For Even More Speed)

We want to push the mining speed even further, and there are several ways to gain additional modifier slots right away:
- Diamond + Gold Block → +1 modifier
- Enchanted Golden Apple + Diamond Block → +1 modifier
- Nether Star → +1 modifier (if you're up for defeating a Wither early!)

Later on, once you reach MV, you’ll start obtaining Creative Modifiers from lootbags, which can add even more modifier slots for free. And as you continue to use the hammer, it will gain levels naturally, some of which come with extra modifiers as well.

By applying all your modifiers as early as possible, you maximize your return on every trip into the mines. More speed = more ores = faster progression

### Upgrading to Unstable: Making the Hammer Unbreakable
Once you've built your Magical Wood hammer and applied all your modifiers, it's time to turn it into a permanently unbreakable tool. This is done by replacing all of its parts with ones made from Unstable Ingots, a material that grants the Unbreakable trait automatically.

> Important: Only swap the parts after you've built the original hammer out of Magical Wood and applied your modifiers. Rebuilding the tool from scratch with Unstable parts won't grant you the extra modifier slots.

#### How to Craft Unstable Ingots
1. Find a Division Sigil
    - Can be found in Stage 4 LootGames chests
    - Also appears in Thaumcraft loot chests
2. Find or craft an Enchanting Table (Not craftable in LV)
    - Often located in the Wizard Tower variant of Roguelike Dungeons (hidden second-floor room)
    - Also spawns in the Stage 4 LootGames chests
3. Activate the Division Sigil
    - At midnight, place the Enchanting Table on dirt or grass and right-click it with the Sigil.
    - Perform the activation ritual when prompted (summons lightning and monsters). Once complete, the Sigil becomes Activated.
4. Craft the Unstable ingots.
    - The first way to do this is by crafting the unstable nuggets with a gold nugget, the activated sigil and a diamond. These can later be alloy smelter moulded into ingots.
    - The second way is to craft the ingots directly with an iron ingot, the activated sigil and a diamond. Make sure to craft more than one at a time by using the shift+click method to complete the craft. This make the unstable ingots stable and they will not explode when you exit the crafting interface.
 > Warning: Crafting the unstable ingots one at a time at the crafting table will cause them to explode either after 10 seconds or when you exit this crafting interface. This method of crafting does not work for the hammer craft where the ingots need to be taken to a separate machine after crafting.

 #### Crafting the Tool Parts
Once you have 27 Unstable Ingots, use an LV Extruder to form them into Tinkers’ Construct tool parts. You’ll need:
- Hammer Head
- 2x Large Plates
- Tough Tool Rod

Use your Tool Forge to replace each of the hammer’s parts with their Unstable equivalents. Your existing modifiers will remain untouched.

Congratulations! You have made the only hammer that you will need for the rest of the game!
