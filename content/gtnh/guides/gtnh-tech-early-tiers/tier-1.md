# Tier -1: And So, It Begins

Welcome to GregTech New Horizons! One of the hardest, but also one of the most rewarding modpacks ever created. Are you ready to dump 1000s of hours into long chemical lines, large scale automations, magic, bees and exploration as you try and craft the elusive and infamous Stargate? Well, your journey starts here.

## Rush the bed
Hostile mob spawns in GTNH are unforgiving. Think ‘creepers that explode into a ball of cobblestone with infernal silverfish spawn eggs’ levels of unforgiving. You do not want to fight these guys on your first night. Trust me. Your only other option (besides hiding in a dirt hole for 10 minutes contemplating your life) is to try and rush the bed. This requires a bit of luck but hopefully these steps will give you a helping hand.

*(Do not follow the questbook for the bed, it takes far too long)*

You need:
- At least 6 Sheep
- A reasonable supply of easy-access wood and gravel

Steps:
1. Kill 6 sheep with your fist (crafting a flint sword for this is not worth the extra 6 gravel) for their 6 wool drops
2. Mine 9 gravel and 4 wood with your fist
3. Turn the gravel into flint and make a crafting table

4. Craft a flint shovel

5. Dig up 9 more gravel with your flint shovel
6. Craft a flint axe

7. Use the new axe to mine 16 more wood
8. Craft the bed!

## Choosing a base location

There are a number of important factors to consider when choosing a place to settle, that are mostly not always obvious.

- **Humidity:** This is by far the most important thing to consider. There is no infinite water source in the game (because Greg), so you have to generate it yourself. If you settle in a biome with high humidity this will significantly improve your water production rate. You ideally want somewhere with at least 60% humidity.

- **Wood:** You need a lot of wood in the early game, and you don’t get access to the tinkers lumber axe until the middle of the Steam Age. Make your life easier by settling in a biome with a lot of trees, which are quick to chop down with a regular axe (ie not very tall or fat ones).
- **Clay:** Clay is needed in very large quantities in the early tiers (particularly Steam and MV). By far the best source of clay is hardened clay (it macerates straight into 1 clay dust), so it’s a good idea to settle near a mesa biome with an abundant supply.
- **Oil:** You will need oil in LV and MV, and until the oil drilling rig, your only source is in world oil deposits or oilsand veins. To make your life easier, try to settle within a few hundred blocks of one of the in world oil spills.

## Things to look out for

I imagine you’ll be exploring for quite a bit looking for a base spot. Even if you find somewhere quickly, its worth taking some time to explore the world. Listed here are the important things to be looking out for.

- Aluminium gravel deposits are your only real source of aluminium until you reach MV - make sure to grab every one you can.
- Rougelike dungeons contain an abundant source of bricks, something you will need a lot of in Steam and LV. Mark down the location of any one that you find.

- Villages have plenty of useful goodies. Doors, fences, pressure plates, bookshelves (all of which have greggified recipes of course), crops, railcraft houses with more bricks. If you’re lucky you can also find a smeltery village, allowing you to skip most of the tedious crafting involved (you can't get the quest rewards this way though!).
- The natura berry bushes are a good early game food source.

- Grab all the Pams gardens you see. You can left click to break the garden for some plantable crops and right click to pick up the garden to be placed down later (they spread naturally when planted). Because of Spice of Life, you have to eat a variety of foods or face diminishing returns, so these crops are important. You also need 8 of each type of farm to unlock the healing axe later on.
- The sticky resin from IC2 rubber trees is needed for the first water tanks. Look out for these and grab some saplings.
