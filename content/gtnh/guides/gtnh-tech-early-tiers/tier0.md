# Tier 0: Stone age
In this chapter you begin to settle down in your base location. You get your first tinkers tools, start some basic farms and mine your first ore veins. Oh, and your first multiblock is unlocked: the coke oven!

## Coke Oven
In GTNH you can’t get charcoal just by smelting wood in a furnace. Instead you need the railcraft coke oven. Once you have this you can craft your first torches and head to the mines! The questbook does a good job of guiding you through the steps to make this but you will need the following amount of sand and clay (balls)
- 105 Clay
- 175 Sand

## Farms
You’ll want to setup some basic farms while you wait for charcoal to build up. Here are some good things to get planted:
- Natura berries - good early game food source that grows quickly
- Wheat and/or barley - for bread!
- Cotton - used to make string (who wants to fight those infernal spiders) and a lot of QoL items. You want to setup a big area for this.
- Soybeans - you need a lot for the healing axe quest if you go that route
- Pams gardens - these spread naturally when placed in world, you need 8 of each for the healing axe quest and they all give useful food you can plant as well

## Ore Veins
Once you have torches and tinkers tools, its time to get your first ores! However, ore generation is very different to what you’re probably used to. Instead of being evenly spread out in underground caves, ores are concentrated within ore chunks, and only certain ores may spawn in each chunk, defined through the type of ore vein. In modern versions of the pack, it is easy to find ore veins, simply press F9 three times and the vertical blue lines denote the center of an ore chunk. You can dig straight down from there to find out what type of vein it is! It is worth doing some prospecting near your base to find out what is available (and to get the 256 cobble for the iron pickaxe upgrade). Here are some useful veins to look out for:
- Iron - Every ore in this vein smelts into iron bar Malechite, which smelts into copper.
- Copper - Copper and chalcopyrite ore smelt directly into copper. Pyrite smelts directly into iron ingots.
- Tin - Cassiterite sand smelts directly into two(!) tin ingots. Asbestos is also needed in LV for the Electric Blast Furnace (EBF).
- Redstone - Redstone ore can be processed into redstone dust. Ruby will also be useful in MV for chrome.
- Lapis - The calcite is needed for the Bricked Blast Furnace (BBF) in steam age. Lapis can also be put on tinkers tools to give fortune - very useful with the addition of small ore drops in 2.7!
- Mineral Sands- The gypsum is needed for the BBF. Both types of mineral sand ore smelt directly into iron.
- Gold - Magnetite smelts directly into iron. Gold ore smelts directly into gold. Vanadium magnetite is a good source of vanadium, used for vanadium steel in MV which is a very strong material for tinkers tools.
- Coal - Coal is an alternative to charcoal for fuel. It also provides a more efficient torch recipe. Lignite coal has no use other than a fuel, which is quite handy for the steam boilers.
- Diamond - You need diamonds to make macerators in steam age. There is also sporadic coal ore.
- Mica - This is the rarest overworld vein. It is needed for all EBF coils other than cupronickel so keep an eye out. The cassiterite also smelts into tin.

## Tinkers Smeltery
Some of the above ores need a mining level higher than what is obtained through a flint/iron pickaxe. To upgrade, you’ll need bronze tools, which requires a tinkers smeltery. You have 2 options for this. Either go search for a village and stea- sorry, temporarily co opt their one, or craft it yourself from scratch. Beware! If you use the villager route you will not get the quest reward. It’s up to you if its worth it.

## Getting Redstone
To process redstone (and other dusts) from ores, follow these steps:

1. Break with a GT hammer in word (crushed ore)
2. Craft with a GT hammer (impure dust)
3. Throw in a vanilla cauldron with water

The 1st step can be done with a macerator (also doubles output), the 2nd with a forge hammer and the 3rd with a simple washer or ore washer, when these machines are unlocked.

## QoL Upgrades
Once you have the first GT tools, a lot of QoL upgrades become available. You don't have to do them all straight away especially if you want to wait for cheaper plates etc in LV but  here’s a few worth thinking about:
- Iron chests/barrels - more storage space!
- Ore finder wand - you can put ores or ingots into it’s inventory slot. It will then notify you when an associated ore vein is nearby
- Forestry backpacks - these automatically store items when you pick them up, depending on the type of backpack. For example, the diggers backpack will pick up cobble and dirt, the miners will pick up ores.
- Bigger lunchbox - this has 6 slots, exactly the number of different foods needed to cycle through the spice of life variety requirement

Get your first bronze and the coal boiler then it’s time to enter the Steam Age!
