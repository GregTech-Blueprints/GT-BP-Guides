# Potion brewing - Shifting Seasons
Witchery is an interesting magic mod which can be hard to navigate because by the mod design, the internal documentation is esoteric and doesn’t tell you everything that you might want to know. But that doesn’t change the fact that this mod can be really useful, most notably for its biome changing tool : the shifting season potion or ritual.

Both the potion and the ritual will change the biome, they have different pros and cons. The potion is easier to make and use but will convert a smaller area, from 1 block to 3 block radius in a diamond pattern, centered where the potion land. The ritual is harder to pull off but done well, it will convert a massive area in one go.

This guide will focus on getting you to shifting seasons potion while diving deeper in Witchery mechanics, helping you understand how it all work and creating some of the best shifting season potion setup possible. All of which is possible in MV (Medium Voltage).

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/01.png)

## Basic requirements
Even with the quickest way to get to the shifting seasons, you do need a couple of thaumcraft research, a few witchery seeds, the book of biome (extended version), a mv mixer and a mv laser engraver.

The minimal research needed, which will give around 3 total warp, are:
- Anointing paste
- Witch oven
- Witchery altar

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/02.png)

The book of biome can be found in a village or can be crafted. As of 2.7.4, all of the items necessary for the book of biome can be crafted. Other easy ways to get them are: in the Twilight forest hills biome for podzol, Mesa biome for clay, hot desert for quicksand and using a mutating sprig on grass for mycelium.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/04.png)

The seeds can be easily acquired by using a hoe or a mattock on grass away from any water.

## Basic witchery

To begin with witchery you will need two thaumcraft research on the witchery tab:
- Witch oven research
- Anointing paste research

Once all the research is done, you will need to craft your first witch oven, its a special furnace that will allow you to extract fumes from various saplings. Fumes are a witchery ingredient type, used in a lot of recipes, they are collected in clay jar, witchery’s special bottle made of clay.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/05.png)

You will quickly notice that the fume extraction rate of the basic witch oven is not great, it can be improved by adding fume funnel around the oven and eventually filtered fume funnels. But both need another research and the latter need thaumcraft infusion. They aren’t required for progression, but they are a nice upgrade. 

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/06.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/07.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/08.png)

Next up is crafting your witch cauldron. To do so you will need to craft the anointing paste. To craft the paste, you need a MV mixer and a couple of witchery seeds, namely belladona, mandrake, water artichoke and snowbell seeds. All of them can be easily obtained by right clicking grass with a mattock or hoe.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/09.png)

With the anointing paste, right click a cauldron to transform it into a witch cauldron. Be warned that you need to have the anointing paste research for the transformation to be possible. To work, the cauldron need a fire below it so be careful if you have flammable things nearby. It can be filled with up to 3 water buckets, pipes can’t insert water into it your only choices to fill the witch cauldron is by hand or with the erverfull urn.

The witch cauldron is the most important tool of witchery, its in there that you will craft a lot of special items and potions like the shifting season potion. The first item you will need to craft in the cauldron to progress is called mutandis.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/10.png)

You need to drop in a full cauldron the following items in that order : a mandrake root, a exhale of the horned one and an egg. Every time you throw an ingredient in the cauldron, the color of the water will change. If you did it correctly, after throwing the last ingredient a spiral of particle will rise from the cauldron and after a few seconds you will get your first mutandis. Be warned that every time you do a recipe in the cauldron, you risk getting bad effects if your cauldron is not warded. See more on cauldron warding in its own section.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/11.png)

Mutandis will allow you to transform any grass, sapling or flower into another grass, sapling or flower items at random. The main things we are after here the 3 witchery saplings:
- Rowan sapling
- Alder sapling
- Hawtorn sapling

Other interesting items that can appear along the way that might be interesting to grab are: glint weed, spanish moss & ember moss.

Once you have the saplings, grow them and farm them in order to have more of them, the main things we want is the saplings to smelt them in the witch oven to get specials fumes needed for later.

Be warned that every time you cut down one of the witchery tree, you risk spawning an ent, an aggressive tree mob that will attack you. You can easily know when one is spawn because a special particle effect with a sound cue happens when you cut the tree.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/12.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/13.png)

The ent can be a bit tanky and do some damage to unsuspecting player but they don’t have a lot of reach so simply building a pillar a couple of block tall should allow you to kill them unarmed. The ent can loot any witchery saplings as well as an ent twig which can be used for a mutating sprig, a tool that can change grass into mycelium among other things.

Now with a witch oven, cauldron and witchery trees, you can go deeper into witchery and finally make an altar.

## Witchery altar

The witchery altar is the main magic generator & battery of witchery, allowing you to make advanced potions and rituals. To make one, you need the witchery altar research from thaumcraft. You will need 6 altar blocks. The altar will form once you make a 2x3 shape with the altar block, once formed the altar block will appear to have a red carpet on top.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/14.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/15.png)

Altar power and regeneration work like this: altar power is the current energy available from the altar for anything that need it, its maximum cap is decided by the surrounding. Altar regeneration is the rate at which the altar is earning power, from what I could tell the altar earn 10 power per second, multiplied by the regeneration rate.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/16.png)

The altar power cap and power generation speed depend on the surrounding, it will check for any valid block in a 31 x 31 x 31 cube centered around the last altar block placed. The general rule is that any nature block in that cube will provide altar power until you have too many of that block. """"A list of all the possible augment can be found here [link to a spreadsheet or similar].""""

A good way to raise altar power a lot is to plant various trees in around the altar, making a small forest. Mixing vanilla trees, a couple of BoP trees, witchery trees and the thaumcraft trees along with altar upgrades will easily cover your bases. You will need around 5500 altar power to make the shifting season potion, but having more will always be nice.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/17.png)

Altar upgrades need to be put on the altar itself to work as upgrades. Some of the possible altar upgrades are:

- skeleton, wither or player skull: double, triple or quadruple altar power and add +1/+2/+3 altar regeneration
- torch or candelabra: add +1 or +2 altar regeneration
- pentacle: add +1 altar regeneration
- arthana: increase the altar range to power ritual or devices
- chalice or filled chalice: double or triple altar power
- infinity egg: multiply by 10 both altar power and altar regeneration

One important thing to take into account is that some of the upgrades block can also provide altar power, regardless of their power as upgrades.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/18.png)

In a pinch, a regular dragon egg placed in the altar’s area will give a good altar power boost because it give 250 altar power by itself, before taking into account potential altar upgrades.

Here is how to obtain some of altar upgrades:
- Skeleton and wither skull are mob loot, but are also easy to find in rogue like dungeons. The player skull can be obtained by dying, crafted with botania without dying in IV, obtained with the tricky bee or with the loot game quest.
- The candelabra and the chalice need to be crafted, the quest for the chalice can give you as a reward a redstone soup, allowing you to fill it easily.
- The infinity egg can be obtained early with a secret hidden quest if you defeat all of witchery’s boss as well as the king slime, but it will cost you some witchery advanced items and a primordial pearl.

# Potion Brewing
Witchery potion brewing is based on two mechanics: alchemical potency and brewing expertise.

Alchemical potency is what determine the potion power, duration, effects, dispersal and dispersal duration.

Brewing a potion can be separated into 6 different steps, some optional:

1. The first thing to do for every brew is to set the capacity, every effect need the brew to have at least equal or more capacity than their base need and a corresponding catalyst item. Capacity is additive but only one item of each can be added and you need to add items in order of increasing capacity for it to have effects. Capacity items are:
    - mandrake root for +1 capacity
    - nether wart for +2 capacity
    - tear of the goddess for +2 capacity
    - diamond vapor for +2 capacity
    - diamond for +2 capacity
    - nether star for +4 capacity

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/19.png)

Shifting season for example is a 8 capacity effect, so to reach it you have several possible paths:
- nether wart, tear of the goddess, diamond vapor & diamond
- tear of the goddess, diamond vapor & nether star
- nether wart, diamond vapor & nether star

The 3rd path above is particularly important because you don’t need any more witchery infrastructure to make it, meaning with it you can make shifting seasons potion as soon as you have an altar.

2. Once the capacity is set, you can if you want improve the potion power, for example improving a poison 1 to a poison 2, 3 or 4. To do that you need to use a power catalyst, like for capacity they are additive, each adding another power level, you need to use them in order of increasing potency but only one of each can count. Power items are:
    - glowstone dust
    - blaze rod
    - attuned stone (charged)

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/20.png)

Of course you don’t need to use all of them every time or at all. For example to get a poison 3 potion you could any of theses paths:

- glowstone and then blaze rod
- blaze rod and then attuned stone
- glowstone and then attuned stone

For our shifting season potion, the potion power is what will actually decide the size of the area converted to a new biome. A power 1 shifting season only convert 1 block. Power 2 to 4 will increase the area of affect in a diamond pattern as seen in the overview screenshot.

3. After power, if its relevant for the potion effect you are targeting, you can also increase the potion duration with duration catalyst items. Like before, they need to be added in increasing potency order, each adding double of the base duration of the potion. Duration items are:
    - redstone dust
    - obsidian
    - minedrake bulb

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/21.png)

Like before, you can mix and match, not needing them all every time but the order of redstone before obsidian before minedrake bulb need to be preserved.

4. Once power & duration are done, you can finally set the potion effect with the catalyst you want. Please remember that you need at least enough capacity for the desired effect. A complete list of the effect catalyst and possible potion effect can be found in the Witches’ Brew book. For shifting seasons its now that you will use the biome page of your desired biome. A reminder that shifting seasons potion need 8 capacity.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/22.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/23.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/24.png)

5. After the effect, you can improve the time the potion will stay active in world for gas & liquid dispersal with lingering catalyst items, like before you need to add them in increasing potency. The lingering items are:
    - belladonna flower
    - Lapis lazuli
    - end stone

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/25.png)

6. Finally its time to choose the dispersal method, if you don’t do anything at this step you will get a standard potion that you can drink. Otherwise you can choose among the 4 other dispersal types:
    - instant, like the vanilla instant potion, you throw them and the effect will happen where the potion land.
    - gas, you throw the potion and where it land a cloud of potion effect will appear giving the potion effect to any entity stepping in the cloud. Disperse after some time.
    - liquid, you throw the potion and where it land create a puddle of potion that will affect any entity stepping on it. Disperse after some time.
    - Trigger, a special type that will push buttons or activate ritual in the area of effect.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/26.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/27.png)

The dispersal items are:
- gunpowder or water artichoke for instant
- wool of bat for gas
- wormwood for liquid
- zombie head for trigger

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/28.png)

All of the above is what you need to create the potion you want in your cauldron, otherwise called brewing the potion. To get the potion out of the cauldron, you need to bottle it by right clicking the cauldron with an empty glass bottle. It is only when you bottle a potion that altar power is consumed depending on the ingredients used along the way. If you don’t have enough altar power to make the potion, then right clicking the cauldron will not do anything. Even if your brew is ruined with no real effect you can always bottle it if you have enough altar power.

If at any point you messed up your potion preparation and want to clear your cauldron to start on a clean slate again, you can either break the cauldron to empty it, or throw into the cauldron either a piece of witchery gypsum or witchery quicklime to clear it.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/29.png)

An important note is that, as far as I can tell, potions left in the cauldron don’t decay, they stay there until you bottle them.

Lets now go back to our shifting season potion. Lets say we want to make a mesa biome for bees in an alveary:

First of, we will need to prepare at least 8 capacity worth of ingredients. Because of our limited Witchery infrastructure, we will use nether wart (+2), a diamond (+2) and a nether star (+4).

Now, we want to cover all our alveary with the mesa biome, to do that we will need a shifting season potion of power 3 or 4 (see screenshot size in the overview). To do so, we will use a glowstone dust and a blaze rod, mostly because attuned stone (charged) are expensive and need a ritual to craft.

Then, for shifting season we don’t need any duration so we skip that step and go straight to choosing the effect of our brew. here we want a mesa shifting season so we take our book of biome and we read it to go the mesa page. Fortunately, the mesa page has a quick tab on the side of the book, otherwise we can navigate as usual and go to page 118. Once at the page, we can close the book, it will remember the selected biome and then craft the book with a piece of paper. That will give us a mesa biome page that we can throw in the cauldron.

Finally, because we don’t need any special lingering and just want to throw the potion like any other instant potion, we add a gunpowder in it.

The brew of shifting season is now ready and can be bottled, see the next chapter for more info on that point.

## Potion bottling
Brewing expertise is the hidden mechanic that allow you to get more potion per brew. If you master this, you could make up to 30 shifting seasons potions with just one set of ingredients, greatly increasing efficiency.

The basic is that you as a player have a bottling expertise level that increase every time 30 bottling xp. You get a new bottling xp point every time you bottle a new potion of sufficient complexity, which mean that the if the effect is of high enough capacity level. You don’t get bottling xp when you brew the potion, only when actually bottling the brew meaning you could get several point from a single brew if you bottle it multiple time. You also always get the same amount of xp, regardless of the brew complexity as long as its complex enough.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/30.png)

When you level up to a new level, a small message will appear in chat saying: “You feel more skilled at brewing, perhaps less brew will be wasted from now on”.
You can check your current bottling experience with a seer stone by right clicking it.

You can further increase potion yield with a Witches’ Hat or Baba Yaga’s Hat, a Witches’ robes, a toad familiar and the bottling potion effect. One important thing to note is that for some reason, using a diamond for the brew capacity actually nerf the amount of potions that can be bottled.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/31.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/32.png)

## Cauldron Warding
Every time you craft an item in the witches’ cauldron or perform a ritual, you risk getting a temporary debuff, getting struck by lightning or spawning an illusion which will look and act like any vanilla mob. One important thing is that illusion can’t actually touch you and the opposite is true, they also die on their own after some time. But unfortunately illusions can spawn infernal, allowing them to actually harm you if their infernal effect allow them to, it can also make them immortal if they get the regeneration infernal buff. If that happens, you will need to leave far enough for them to despawn.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/33.png)

The best way to prevent theses debuff or illusions from happening is to ward your cauldron by surrounding it with a magic circle drawn with chalk. You have two options, either use white chalk to completely remove all possible bad effects. Or use red chalk to increase chances of bad effects but decrease altar power consumption when crafting with the cauldron. However I personally haven’t noticed any real altar power cost decrease with red chalk and altar power is pretty easy to come by if you put some effort so I would advise to just ward your cauldron with white chalk. You can draw up to two circles surrounding your cauldron, mixing red & white chalk, one circle might be enough to completely ward off any potential harm, but white chalk is pretty cheap so I would advise to make the two circles anyway.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/34.png)

## Distillation
Distillation in Witchery is done with a block called a distillery, it is needed for higher end ritual and to make better brews. To be able to craft the distillery you will need four more research, giving you a couple more warp:
- Attuned stone (also needed to make the Blood magic altar)
- Witchery kettle
- Witchery spinning wheel
- Distillery

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/35.png)

Crafting the distillery will require a cauldron as well as a good wand, a gold banded greatwood scepter with some vis reduction gear will be barely enough for it. It also require two small stainless steel pipes, because of theses pipes, the distillery might need to be pushed of until HV where you can make the stainless steel. However if you managed to loot at least two ingots before hand, you could still make the distillery in MV.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/36.png)

One important thing is that the distillery need some altar power to run, a negligible amount, but you still can’t run a distillery outside of your altar range.

The main use of the distillery is to refine items into fumes, giving you another way to get some common fumes like whiff of magic and giving you access to advanced fumes like tear of the goddess or diamond vapor. Theses advanced fumes will allow you to make the better shifting seasons brew, without the regular diamond, allowing you to get the most of your bottling expertise.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/potion-brewing-shifting-seasons/37.png)

Another important ingredient crafted in the distillery is refined evil, which will be used to craft the drop of luck in a crafting cauldron. Drop of luck is one of the most common advanced ingredients, used in both the redstone soup craft and for the potion of bottling which will temporarily greatly improve your bottling prowess and allow you to get more potions out of your brews.
