# Witchery Bosses

Witchery is a magic mod with an esoteric internal documentation that doesn’t tell you everything that you might want to know. It host a couple of boss with interesting mechanics, getting to theses boss can be a bit hard but doing so can give you a couple of interesting things.

As of writing, Witchery in gtnh has 5 boss : *The Huntsman*, *Mog & Gulg*, *The Lord of Torment*, *Baba Yaga* and finally *Leonard*. Defeating all of Witchery boss along with the ender dragon, a Witchery demon and a Tinker's slime king will unlock a secret quest to get access to the infinity egg early.

This guide will cover how to summon, defeat and use the loot of the witchery boss and have a couple of appendix that cover other high tier topics.

## Basic requirements

Most of the bosses aren't accessible out of the gate in witchery, so you will need some basic witchery infrastructure, I will detail in each boss section the exact requirement for that boss but almost all of them will need an altar (see the Shifting Seasons guide for more info). 

To complete every boss you will need at an altar, a distillery (see Shifting Seasons guide), a coven (see coven appendix), some demons hearts (see demon appendix), some koboldite (see hobgoblin appendix), knowledge of the rituals (see ritual appendix) and a couple more Thaumcraft research mentioned in their respective area.

## The Huntsman

The huntsman is the easiest boss of Witchery, it doesn't have any immunity or special strength so you can kill it easily from a distance with your crossbow. It doesn't have ranged attack but can cause explosion where it stand so beware not to fight it in the middle of your base. The Huntsman always loot 3 wither skulls, an enchanted book at random, a demonic blood and its spear. The spear is the best loot of its loot because its the only weapon guaranteed to work on every other boss.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/huntsman_loot.png)

There are two way to summon the huntsman, one is specific to gtnh and is easier and cheaper. I will details both. 

### Summon way 1

The first way is the vanilla Witchery way. For it you will need to have access to a witchery distillery (see guide one) and demon hearts (see demon appendix).

To summon the Huntsman, you will need 20 bloodied wicker bundles which can be crafted from wicker bundles and demonic blood by batch of 5. Wicker bundles are easy to craft, you just need 9 of any sapling in a crafting grid, you can also mix and matches different kinds of saplings. Demonic blood on the other hand can only be obtained by distilling a demon's heart either with diamond vapor or netherack. The diamond vapor recipe is strictly better so use it if you can.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demonic_blood.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/wicker_bundle.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/bloodied_wicker_bundle.png)

Once you have the bundle, you will need to arrange them in a "wicker man" shape, like you could have found in the wild with hay bales. Then set it on fire with anything and that will summon the Huntsman in place. A thing to note is that not all the bloodied wicker bundles are consumed in the summoning, quite a lot of them will stay there, some of them might be invisible due to a visual glitch. The fire will still spread to them and burn them down so if you want to summon several Huntsman this way try to save them.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/wicker_huntsman.png)

### Summon way 2

The second way was added by gtnh and is much easier and cheaper. You will basically buy a Huntsman spawn egg from the quest book. You will only need a couple of magic coins and to do the witchery's altar quest to unlock that coin quest. (To unlock the altar, see guide one) Once you get the horn of the hunt, just use it where you want to summon the boss. The quest is repeatable every 40 minutes.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/altar_quest.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/horn_quest.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/horn_questb.png)

## Mog & Gulg

No its not two different boss, its a pair of boss always summoned together. They are the hobgoblin deities, and a mid tier boss. The summon them you will need an altar (see guide one), some koboldite ingot (see hobgoblin appendix) and know how to use rituals (see ritual appendix).

### Summoning

To summon them you will need to make some hobgoblin  pray to a false idol, that is easy as they will automatically start to pray to any false idol nearby. Once you have at least 5 kobold praying, Mog and Gulg can now be summoned at anytime on the idol, they tend to kill the hobgoblin in the process. Once the hobgoblin are praying, the boss can summon itself naturally at random, but that can take some time. To speed things, you can force the summon at any time by right clicking the idol with a nether star while the kobolds are praying. 

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/praying.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/molg_gulg.png)

Making the false idol is the hardest part of that summoning, to do so you will need a full ingot of koboldite to make the false idol statue and then bind it to yourself with a ritual. Once the ritual succeed, the statue item should now have your name on it and take your character skin. Do not loose that statue, it can be reused for every subsequent summoning.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/statue_recipe.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/statue_binding.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/statue_circle.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/statue.png)

You now only have to take at least 5 hobgoblin near the statue and they will start to pray by themselves, while they are praying you will slowly recharge Witchery's mana but if you want to use that to recharge mana, keep the hobgoblin at 4 maximum to not accidentally summon the boss.

### Fight
The pair is not that strong but have a special mechanic, they are invulnerable when they are close enough to each other, otherwise they get a defensive and healing buff from being close to each others. Gulg will attack in close combat, is fast and strong. Mog shoot from a distance and is slower. While the two of them are still alive, they can teleport to each other from time to time. You can attack them with a crossbow.

The strategy to defeat them is to be attract Gulg a bit away from Mog and shoot either one of them to death. If they are too far from each other they will teleport to the same place so you can't take Gulg too far away. Once you killed one, the other will loose a lot of its buff and all possibility of invulnerability so its easy to kill the second then. They both can loot some koboldite nugget and their special equipment, a quiver for Mog and a belt for Mog. Their special equipment is almost entirely useless in gtnh. The koboldite nugget however is quite good, as that is the best koboldite source in the game.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/mog.png)

## Lord of torment

The Lord of torment is one of the most underwhelming boss of Witchery, its buggy, mostly useless and doesn't loot anything worthwhile for gtnh. To summon it you will need an altar and distillery (see guide one), to know how to use rituals (see ritual appendix), a bed that you slept in, the warm blood research and having a small coven.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/warm_blood_research.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/warm_blood.png)

### Summoning part 1 : the imp

To summon the lord of torment you need the parchment of torment, that can only be given to you by an imp that you befriended. Summoning an imp is similar to summoning a demon but this time we want to establish a contract with the imp. To do so, you need to make a demonic contract bound to yourself. To bind the contract to yourself, first bind a taglock to yourself by right clicking an empty taglock on your last slept bed. Then craft an unbound contract with the bound taglock, you should now have a bound demonic contract.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demonic_contract.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/taglock_recipe.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/taglock.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/binding_contract.png)

You can now summon the imp with the coven ritual and then right click it with the contract to bind it, you will need around 20 level of xp for the bind to be successful. Once bound you can feed the imp shinny items (read here diamonds, emeralds and gold) to make it appreciate you more. Every time you gift it something, it will give you something in return. When you give it something, a 10 minute cooldown start preventing from giving it more things. When it like you enough, it will give you a parchment of torment, which is what you need to summon the boss.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/imp.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/torment.png)

### Summoning part 2 : 

The torment in hand, you now only need two things to summon the lord of torment : magic power and a witch circle. The circle is easy to find, its a structure randomly generated everywhere. For magic power you need to infuse yourself with magic in an infusion ritual. There are four different self infusion ritual, each needing a different circle and magical catalyst. I will cover the infernal animus one as i find it the easiest to do. Simply do the self infusion ritual after crafting the infernal animus in a kettle, if everything work properly you should now see a new magic meter appear on the left side of your screen.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/self_infusion.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/infernal_animus.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/ritual_otherwhere.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/mana.png)

Now go in the right middle of the witch circle (the water part) and maintain right click the torment, that will slowly drain your magic power and will take around a third. Stopping midway will cancel the summoning but the magic power used won't be refunded. You will quickly notice when the summon succeed as that will create an explosion and spawn the boss.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/witch_circle.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/aftermat.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/lord_torment.png)

### The fight part 1 :

The lord of torment fight is more annoying than it is hard. The boss fly and will attack from a distance with exploding fireball. It also has a damage cap of 5 with almost all weapons, the best way is to spam it with a ranged weapons. Unfortunately most wand focus don't seem to hit the boss very well, often missing so i would rather recommend a trusty gatling crossbow. The boss might fly away far from reach so i also recommend having some flight options. And as said before, its main form of attack are explosive so don't fight it near your base.

### The fight part 2 :

Once mid life, the boss will teleport itself and you to the torment dimension, a laggy labyrinth like dim where it sit in the middle, waiting for you. That part can be buggy, not teleporting you, not teleporting or despawning the boss so the quest book actually give you a spawn egg for the boss in the related quest in the witchery tab just in case. If nothing bugs out, that part of the fight is actually easier because the boss won't be able to fly away as much, but he does hit harder in this dim so be careful.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/labyrinth.png)

Once properly killed, an exit should open on the other side of the labyrinth, just go to it and exit this dimension. The lord of torment has no notable loot aside from a potion that unlock a spell allowing you to send a friend to that labyrinth dim once every 30 minutes.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/torment_loot.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/exit.png)

## Baba Yaga

One of the two high tier and interesting boss of witchery, with lot of new mechanic, plenty of quirkiness and the best boss loot of Witchery : baba's yaga's hat. To summon her you will need an altar and a kettle (see guide one) and the quartz sphere research.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/quartz_research.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/quartz_recipe.png)

### Summoning part 1 : the crystal ball

The first thing you will need is to make a crystal ball to be able to divine the future. The crystal ball is crafted in a ritual at night, if you aren't at night the ritual won't start, saying "unknown rites". For the ritual you will need a quartz sphere and a happenstance oil which you can make in a kettle.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/happenstance.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/crystal_ball.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/familliar_circle.png)

### Summoning part 2 : spamming predictions

Now that you have the crystal ball, put near your altar, and right click it. That will consume a meaningless amount of altar power and will send in chat a prediction. There are two baba yaga prediction, one where you summon her as a friendly npc that will give you gift and one where you summon her as a boss fight. What prediction you can get is random, but if you get the friendly prediction, you won't be able to get it again until you have a baba yaga fight prediction, the same if true for the baba yaga fight prediction.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/crystal.png)

As said above, the prediction you get is random, and to get a new prediction you either need to complete the prediction you were given or wait around 20 minutes for the prediction to refresh, clicking the crystal again before will just yield the same prediction. So i will list all the possible prediction messages and what to do to solve them quickly.

| prediction                                                                                            | solution                                      | tip                                                                                   |

You really just have to cycle the predictions until you get the baba yaga fight. The prediction that spawn things like friendly baba yaga, the ent or the villager can be quite slow to spawn, sometime taking a dozen minute.

### The fight :

Baba Yaga fight is interesting. She will mainly fight by throwing custom witchery potion at you, large variety of options from direct damage, to spreading fire, making you bigger or smaller, poison, wither etc. She can also summon wolfs or cats to attack you. She can teleport around, she has a thorn like effect if you attack here with anything else than a wooden weapons and can heal herself with potions. Baba Yaga loot various high tier witchery ingredients which can be useful but her best loot is her hat which can allow you to double your potion yield from any cauldron brewing as long as you have any level of expertise.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/baba_loot.png)

## Leonard

The second high tier boss fight of Witchery. Again a lot of special mechanics, invulnerability and quirkiness. He can loot Leonard's Urn which can in theory make any potion infinite. To summon him you will need an altar and distillery (see guide one).
An important point is that its a hard fight and its timed. Even knowing everything and being prepared i still died once during my testing.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/leonard.png)

### Summoning :

Leonard summon is fairly straightforward, you need to do a cauldron ritual at 12 potency so you will need every potency ingredient except for mandragora. It cost around 10 000 altar power to summon him, so be prepared to have a big altar.
Just throw in the cauldron, in that order : a nether wart, a tear of the goddess, a diamond vapor, a diamond, a nether star and a witch hat. Once you everything is in the cauldron, some particle should start to appear, like when you craft mutandis. Then lightning will strike and Leonard will appear. **He is not aggressive by default** so you can take some time before actually fighting him. Having Leonard hanging around also have some benefits, it increase the range of your rituals and allow you to use them for interdim targets.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/leonard_summon.png)

### Demonsbane potion :

Before fighting Leonard, you need to prepare a lot of demonsbane potions, as its the only thing that can kill him in his last phase. Demonsbane is a 5 potency brew so you have a lot of choices to reach it. I recommend making it at least power 3 and to make them air for their dispersal as its what will work best again Leonard. My recipe is simple in that order 1 nether wart & 1 nether star (you can replace this by anything else that reach at least 5 potency), then a glowstone dust, a blaze rod, an ice block and finally a wool of bat. You can then bottle the brews. Here if you have baba yaga's hat or raised your brewing expertise they can really shine. I would recommend making at least 20 power 3 demonsbane potions for the fight but you might need more, in testing i used around 30 in phase 3 alone.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demonbane.png)


### The fight overview :

Leonard boss fight can be started anytime while he is hanging around, you just need to attack him. When you start the fight he will inflict you with a potion effect called "mortal coil" that will kill you once it end, that effect can't be cleared with milk or terra wart and will kill you regardless of your game mode. He has 3 phases for each third of his life and the strategy to fight him depend on his phase. All throughout the fight, Leonard will set on fire any lingering, liquid or air potions that you threw at or near him. To properly defeat him **you will need a lot of demonsbane potion**, a special witchery potion that is the only thing that can damage him in phase 3.

### The fight part 1 :

His first phase is pretty simple, he can attack you in close quarter or with various witchery spells, some of them can be quite dangerous so be careful of its projectiles. He doesn't have any immunities or special attack yet so just attack him with a good weapon to reduce is life quickly.

### The fight part 2 :

Now things start to get interesting, in phase two he will continue with the previous attacks but now he will also summon *lost souls* in three colors, green, red and blue. The lost souls are flying mob that will attack you in close quarter but they are immune to certain types of damage depending on their color. As long as at least one lost soul is still alive, Leornard is almost completely invulnerable, only sensible to demonsbane potions. You can also just spam attack on him after killing most of the souls, his immunity sometime slip for a second, allowing you to still hit it somewhat. 

Try to kill the lost souls as quickly as possible to go back to fighting Leonard normally. Green souls don't have any resistances, red souls are only sensible to fire and explosions. Blue souls are supposed to be only sensible to potions. A fire focus on a wand can help kill most of the green and red lost souls quickly, blue souls however can remain a pain. I am unsure if the latter can be affected by Thaumcraft wand, it looked like it in my testing, but i was also in the middle of a messy boss fight

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/lost_souls.png)

### The fight part 3 :

The last phase is easy to notice because Leonard grow bigger and is suddenly invulnerable to everything except demonsbane potion. There is no other ways to inflict damage at this point. Leonard also tend to start to regenerating at this point but is also slower and generally less dangerous. One thing to remember is that Leornard will set on fire any lingering or liquid potion near it, so be careful to not have a big fire because you are most likely in the middle of your base or at least the witchery greenery. Once you finally kill Leonard, the potion effect should dissipate and you get its loot. The main thing is the urn that allow you to make any brew infinite with witchery spell casting.

## Ritual ABC

After brewing, ritual are the second big mechanic of Witchery, giving you access to a lot of new tools and qol. To start with ritual you will need a working altar and a distillery (see guide one), a ritual talisman and some chalks. Rituals will consume altar power so they need to be within your altar's reach. I also recommend keeping the "Witchcraft: Circle Magic" book on you when you want to make a ritual, that will help you.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/ritual_research.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/ritual_circle.png)

The various chalks will allow you to draw the ritual circle depending on the ritual you need. Each chalk has 64 durability, the actual symbol down on the ground don't matter much and are chosen at random. White and red chalk are easy to get in MV with just a basic altar and cauldron setup. Gold however will need a distillery for the diamond vapor. And purple chalk is the most gated, needing a manuyllyn crystal, limiting it to EV (or get some from lootbag or quest reward early).

Every ritual circle is composed of a heart in gold chalk and one or more circle in the other color. You can mix and match theses circles, the chalk color and circle size is determined by the specific ritual you are trying to do. Below an example of a 7x7 circle in white, 11x11 circle in red and 15x15 in purple. To start a ritual you only need to drop near the gold mark all the items needed and then right click the gold marking with either a ritual circle for regular rituals or a seer stone for coven rituals. For example, for a familiar binding ritual you need a tear of the goddess, an odour of purity, a whiff of magic, a diamond, a demonic blood and the pet you want to bind as a familiar in the circle.

If you didn't drop the correct items or the conditions aren't correct, you will get a message in chat saying "unknown rite". Otherwise the ritual will start, absorbing the items one by one in a puff of smoke. If everything worked properly and you have enough altar power, the ritual will complete, giving you the effect, items or mob in question. Otherwise a big puff of smoke will appear and you will get back all the ritual items.

## Demons summoning & handling

Summoning a demon is easy, handling it to get the most out of it is a bit more complex. You will need an altar and a distillery (see guide one).

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demon_summon.png)

Summoning a demon only need a 15x15 red circle ritual and a couple of items. The special one are the refined evil which you get in a distillery and the other is a charged attuned stone. To charge an attuned stone you need to do a ritual of charging that should give you one attuned stone (charged), one thing to note is that you need witchery wood ash and quicklime, not the gt versions.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/refined_evil.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/ritual_charging.png)

The actual summoning of the demon is the same as any other ritual but beware that they are aggressive and will attack you on sight, sending exploding flaming balls. Unfortunately you can't actually soul vial them or move them with golden lasso. For your first summoning, just focus on killing it quickly and hope for a demon heart.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demon.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/demon_loot.png)

Once you get your first demon heart, use it to craft the devils tongue charm, an item that will make the demon temporarily not attack the player holding it but keep in mind that its temporary and if the demon start to attack, holding the charm won't stop it. Right clicking the demon with the charm will open a trading GUI, among the trade there will be a demon's heart trade. Use it to buy several demons hearts from one demon, removing most of the rng and getting more easier. The demon can ask for a few things for the demon heart, gold ingot, emeralds, blaze rods or diamonds. Once you have traded for what you want from it, kill the demon as it won't despawn and it attack most things.

## Hobgoblin rearing

Hobgoblin can be found in a lot of place, in nature, a village, their hut or near witch's houses. They can have a couple of uses : recharging magic by praying to a false idol, summoning Mog & Gulg, trading or as a source of koboldite. 

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/goblins_hut.png)
![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/goblins_house.png)

Koboldite is a magic mineral added by Witchery with exclusives uses in that mod. It can be used as currency for hobgoblin trade, to make a false idol or to make the pentacle one of the altar upgrade. To get koboldite, there are several possibles sources, except for the trades you can only get koboldite dust : 
- hobgoblin mining which is slow and make a mess
- Kobold farming, manually or with an EEC
- Looting in the Twilight Forest which is unreliable
- Hobgoblin trading which can be the quickest and most reliable early on

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/goblin_trade.png)

What you need however is koboldite ingot, there are no recipes to convert the dust or the nugget to ingot, you have to get them by trading with a hobgoblin. They only accept to trade if they detect a door nearby. If you are lucky, you can unlock the trades that convert dust to nugget and then nuggets to ingots, otherwise their trading mechanic is similar to villagers. I advise you to keep a leveled up trader separated somewhere, they can be moved with a golden lasso.

If you exterminated all the nearby hobgoblin or scarified them all to summon pagan gods, you can always make more, they breed like villagers so you can make a breeder with doors.

## Recruiting a coven circle

A coven is a group of witch that will help you with ritual casting or sometime in combat. You coven can have as many as 6 witch and the more, the stronger the ritual casted with it can be. Some rituals require a coven casting. To start recruiting a coven you need a familiar and complete their coven quest so most likely you need an altar and distillation (see guide one).

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/coven_witch.png)

Binding a familiar require a ritual and a pet of one the possible familiar species which are : cat, owl and toad. Owl and Toads can't be found in the wilds, its species that you need to create with a ritual, the quest book actually explain pretty well how to and they aren't required for a coven so i won't cover how to make them in this guide. Once bound as a familiar, you will receive a buff corresponding to the base species, cats help with curses, owls help with broom flight and toads help with bottling more potions.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/familliar_circle.png)

Once you have bound a familiar, you can now talk to coven witch and accept their quest. If you complete the quest they will join your coven. As said before, you can only have up to 6 witch in your coven and coven witch are easy to find in the wild, in a witch house or in a village so need to bother too much with complex quests.

![image alt text](/img/gtnh/guides/magic/witchery/witchery-bosses/witch_house.png)

Here is the list of possible witch quest and how to resolve them :

| Quest | Solution | Difficulty |
|-------|----------|------------|
| The means to control the dead | give the witch a necromantic stone | one of the hardest quest |
| Kill 30 skeletons and bring me their bones | give the witch 30 bones | one of the easiest quest |
| The beating means to master the infernal dimension | give the witch a demon heart | mid level quest |
| Defeat my pet and bring me its flesh / eye | the witch will spawn a mob, a spider or a zombie, kill it and give the witch a special renamed loot | one of the easiest quest |
| I must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew | give the witch a brew of the grotesque | one of the hardest quest |
| I desire to predict the future | give the witch a crystal ball | mid level quest |

To see how many witch are in your coven you can sneak right click a seer stone, that will send a message in chat giving you information about your coven. You can also hold right click with a seer stone to summon your coven where you are. One last thing to note is that your coven witch can teleport where you are at random at night, which can lead to a funny situation where your coven witch teleport to the moon or the asteroid belt simply because you went there.
